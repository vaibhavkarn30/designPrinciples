#In other languages we have to manually free the memory


1) Obects that are not freed continue to keep on consuming memory and this is sort of memory leak
2) Java avoids the memory leaks by the method of Garbage Collection
3) any object that cannot be reached from a refernce from a stack is eligible for garbage collection. Its is incorrect to say unreferneced object because there can
be say a list in heap referncing two objectst that is stored in the list. But as this list in not refernced these objects will also be cleaned away
4) System.gc() does not provide gurantee that garbage collection would run
5) Even while grabage collecting , it is possible that grabage collectio ran but it still did not garbage collected all objects as its only intention is to keep the heap neat and tidy
6) -Xmx10m -> to run with a lower heap size
