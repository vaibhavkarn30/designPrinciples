Concept Learnt
1) We needed to use stack to like for every element find the next largest element to its right and store the diff

Approach
1) maintained a stack of nextgreaterelement
2) if while inserting current element the stacks top most element is greater then current we just push the current element as we are happy that
the next greatest element we already found at top
3) else we keep popping all the elements less then current element as we are sure they are of no use as they are smaller then curr element also
so anyhow elements to the left of curr element will find this of no use.
