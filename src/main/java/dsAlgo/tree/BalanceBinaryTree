# We need to calculate if a given Binary Tree is Balanced

1) We can maintaina balnced Node which has a boolean value static the balance of the tree
2) we recursively calculate the height of the tree. If any point we see a disbalnce in height we update this variable.
3) And before invoking any other further call to the right side of the tree, we check for this value and cut any further recursive calls
