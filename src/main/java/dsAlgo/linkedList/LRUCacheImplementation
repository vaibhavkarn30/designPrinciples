# Design a DataStructure to Implement LRU Cache

1) Can be done with a combination of DoublyLinkedList and HashMpa
2) We insert only if capacity is not reached
3) In hashmap the most recently used element has to be near to the head and the least recently used towards the tail
4) Whenever we do a get Operation on any node we make sure tht node is deleted from dLL from wherever it is and moved towards the head
