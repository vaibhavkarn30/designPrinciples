Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by wrapping a complicated subsystem.
This reduces the learning curve necessary to successfully leverage the subsystem.
It also promotes decoupling the subsystem from its potentially many clients.
On the other hand, if the Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the features and flexibility that “power users” may need.

So for client it only talks to one class and that one class basically talks to other subsytems.

A classical example of a facade is a restaurant where customer just sees a menu to order and does not look like inner systems that are ther like chefs wait queue e.t.c so this menu basically acts as a facade here
