The vending machine has to maintain inventory records.
The machine should allow a user to select an item and insert cash.
When cash is inserted, the machine should verify that it matches the amount of the chosen item.
When an item is unavailable or there is insufficient cash, the machine must display an error.
Upon successful verification and transaction, the vending machine shall dispense the chosen item to the user.
Ultimately, the user receives the chosen item if all of the previously mentioned stages are successful.
